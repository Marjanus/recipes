# recipes

Application: https://marjanus.github.io/recipes/

The main learning goal for building this application was to explore React's state manipulation, by building a CRUD application, instead of getting data from external APIs. The idea of this application is presented in the Free Code Camp.

The application is built with React, React-Bootstrap. For styling this application react-responsive media queries, SCSS (Node-sass) were used.
